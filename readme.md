# Python packaging examples and utilities

This repo is a work-in-progress and contains examples and utilities for packaging Python according to [my Snakes on a Plane workflow](https://sonotley.github.io/python-deployment-docs/).

If you are looking for the source for the website itself, that is in a different repo [here](https://github.com/sonotley/python-deployment-docs)
